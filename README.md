This program utilizes Multi Level Perceptrons for a binary classification of sonar data. It starts by readingin the data set and splitting the dataframe into the input values and the classification values. Encoding then numerizes the classifications.

The model is created using one hidden layer and a Relu activation function ultimately resulting in a 78% accuracy rate.
